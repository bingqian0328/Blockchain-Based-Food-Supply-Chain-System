# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management System

A decentralized supply chain tracking system built on Ethereum blockchain technology that enables transparent product tracking, verification, and management across the entire supply chain network.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Blockchain Product Tracking**: Create, transfer, and track products with immutable blockchain records
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different interfaces for suppliers, manufacturers, logistics partners, distribution centers, and retailers
- **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Monitor real time product shipments
- **QR Code Generation**: Easily track product history via scannable QR codes
- **Proof of Delivery**: Upload and verify delivery documents with IPFS storage
- **Shipment Status Updates**: Real-time updates with 8 different status levels
- **Invoice and Payment Tracking**: Monitor financial transactions between parties

## ðŸ”§ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity Smart Contracts
- **Maps Integration**: Google Maps API, Geocoding
- **Authentication**: MetaMask Web3 wallet
- **Storage**: IPFS via Pinata for decentralized file storage
- **QR Code**: react-qr-code for product verification

## ðŸ“‹ Smart Contract Structure

The system is built on two primary smart contracts:

1. **Structure.sol**: Defines data structures including:
   - Product data model
   - Role-based user permissions
   - Location data tracking
   - Shipment status enums

2. **SupplyChain.sol**: Implements the core business logic:
   - Product creation and management
   - Ownership transfers
   - Component tracking
   - Event logging for auditing

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MetaMask browser extension
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat or Ganache)
- Google Maps API Key
- IPFS Pinata Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-system.git
cd supply-chain-system
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

#### Using Arbitrum Testnet

You can connect to our pre-deployed smart contract on Arbitrum testnet instead of deploying locally:

1. **Configure Arbitrum Testnet in MetaMask:**
   - Open your MetaMask wallet and click on the network dropdown at the top
   - Click "Add Network" and then "Add Network Manually"
   - Fill in the following details:
     ```
     Network Name: Arbitrum Sepolia
     RPC URL: https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
     Chain ID: 421614
     Currency Symbol: ETH
     Block Explorer URL: https://sepolia.arbiscan.io
     ```
   - Click "Save"

2. **Update Contract Configuration:**
   - Open the `src/contracts/contractConfig.js` file
   - Update the contract address to point to our deployed contract:
     ```javascript
     // filepath: /Users/bingqian/supply-chain-system/src/contracts/contractConfig.js
     export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x709553724500aadA543aaf0378FA9a612235A2a2";
     
     // Make sure the network is set to Arbitrum Sepolia
     export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
       chainId: "421614",
       networkName: "Arbitrum Sepolia"
     };
     ```

3. **Get Testnet ETH:**
   - Request Sepolia ETH from a faucet like https://sepoliafaucet.com/
   - Bridge it to Arbitrum Sepolia using https://bridge.arbitrum.io/

#### Using Private Chain Deployment

If you prefer to deploy the smart contract on your own private chain, check out this https://github.com/bingqian0328/fyp-smart-contract link, follow the deployment steps in readme and update the contractConfig.js file in this repository to use the private chain address

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the application.
